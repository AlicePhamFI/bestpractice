# Onboarding checklist for development projects

This is the onboarding list for you.  The checklist contains the high
level elements you’ll be doing when you start, and you can already have
a look if you wish, but you’ll be given time to go through them on your
first day(s).

This guide and all its links should take you at least 1-2 working days
to read and setup. Once it’s over, and as mentioned near the end of the
guide, contact your tutor and he/she will assign you a project and give
you a simple task to get started with.

- choose which email address, Github account, and (maybe) Gitlab account
  you will be using for your work with us.
  - tell them to your onboarder to get various accesses
- install Slack and Teams applications (for videoconfs)
- check that you can get to the following services (ask for access if
  not):
  - https://helsinkicity.slack.com/
  - https://helsinkisolutionoffice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DD/overview
  - https://gitlab.com/City-of-Helsinki/KuVa
  - https://github.com/orgs/City-of-Helsinki/teams/kuva-developers/repositories

    and ask what they're doing work-wise at the moment

- are you able to set up a development environment for what you're developing,
  where you can actually log in and see your changes?
  - did you get it working with docs?

  sensible difficulty
  - check with your tutor that they think what you're doing is how it
    should be done
- do you know how to update Jira tickets in each phase?
  - https://helsinkisolutionoffice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DD/pages/753745/Jira+instructions
