### Get started here

* This is an onboarding checklist for software developers who join City of Helsinki to get them started!
* The ultimate goal of this checklist is to get you from the moment you start working here to taking a dev ticket as smoothly as possible ðŸ§¡
* The expectation is that you would be **proactive** and read and implement the steps in this checklist pragmatically.
* We know there's plenty of things you need to setup, and therefore we won't ask you to take a dev ticket before you tell us that you're done with this checklist âœ…
* It is fine if you spend ~2 working days to complete this checklist. Or more if needed by letting your tutor know.
* Please consider updating this checklist once you feel you're settled here to prevent this going out of date and causing new team members confusion and hassles.

### Understand City of Helsinki organization as a developer
![City of Helsinki organization as a developer](../static/city_of_helsinki.png)
* City of Helsinki has plenty of **separate** departments, from which the most important ones you'll be dealing with are **KuVa** and **Kanslia**.
* KuVa (Kulttuuri ja Vapaa-aika) is the Culture and Leisure department and Kanslia (Kaupunginkanslia) is the City Hall department.
* KuVa and Kanslia both have:
    * Their own budgets
    * Their own development goals
    * Their own office space
    * Their own developers
    * Their own infrastructure they deploy their services to
* There's plenty of collaboration between KuVa and Kanslia as some of the services developed by Kanslia and deployed in Kanlisa are heavily used by some KuVa services, for example.
* Your onboader on the first day should tell you whether you're working in KuVa or Kanslia, if location of office or other things haven't given it away already ðŸ˜€

### Ensure that you have access to essential services you need as a developer
* Choose an email address of your own that you'd like to use for working in City of Helsinki.
    * Unless you're working for City of Helsinki itself, as a developer, you won't get hel.fi email accounts, but this is being reconsiderred.
* Choose your Github and Gitlab username that you'd like to use for working in City of Helsinki.
* Give your email and Github and Gitlab usernames to your **onbaorder** so they can give you access to:
    * [City of Helsinki Slack](https://helsinkicity.slack.com/)
    * [KuVa's Atlassian for Jira, Confluence, etc](https://helsinkisolutionoffice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DD/overview)
    * [KuVa's Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/City-of-Helsinki/KuVa)
    * [KuVa's Github](https://github.com/orgs/City-of-Helsinki/teams/kuva-developers/members)
* Skim through [this page in Jira](https://helsinkisolutionoffice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DD/pages/851980/Services+and+accounts+for+new+developers) and see if any of
the items there are relavent to you as well.

   * We should ideally remove that page and move its `onboardee` items to here, and it's `onboarder` items to [onboarder's checklist](https://helsinkisolutionoffice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DD/pages/416940090/Onboarding+checklist).

* [Optional] City of Helsinki heavily uses Jira, Slack, and Teams for tasks management and video calls.
You may want to install native clients of those for your operating system or bookmark them for easier access.
