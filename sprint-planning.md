# Sprint planning checklist

Before planning:

  * Product owner has a suggestion of what to do in the next sprint
  * The suggestion adheres to the definition of ready

After planning:

  * Sprint has a goal and is named after the goal (in Jira)
  * sprint backlog is realistic
  * sprint backlog produces the most value with the current sprint: most productive issues by value of implementing the issue divided by story points
  * sprint backlog is ready for development (see the defitition of ready)
  * team has a clear view of what will be done during the next two weeks
  * issues in sprint have story points (0-7 each)
    * issues that are expected to be more than a few days' work are split into smaller ones
    * There should be 4-8 tasks per developer (as they should be of a maximum size of two days)
  * team availability has been calculated (available developer-days / full sprint developer-days)
    * full sprint worth of developer-days is typically 9 days * number of developers
  * team capacity has been calculated (team velocity * team availability)
  * sprint backlog contains team capacity worth of work
  * sprint backlog is documented in Jira
